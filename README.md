Hereâ€™s a short Project Description you can use ðŸ‘‡

This project is an AI-powered text processing application built using React.js (frontend) and Python (backend). The system integrates with the OpenAI API to perform tasks like text summarization, chatbot conversations, paragraph generation, Code conversion, and AI image generation.

The frontend (React.js) handles the user interface and sends requests to the backend. The backend (Python) manages API calls to OpenAI, processes the response, and sends it back to the frontend. All development was done using Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
